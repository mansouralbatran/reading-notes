# React: Component Lifecycle Events
![image](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/lifecycle_reactjs.jpg)

## Mounting
When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase. Constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount all occur in this order during mounting.
## Updating
Anytime a component is updated or state changes then it is rerendered. These lifecycle events happen during updating in this order
## Unmounting
The final phase of the lifecycle if called when a component is being removed from the DOM. componentWillUnmount is the only lifecycle event during this phase.
