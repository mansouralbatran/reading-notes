## How Do I Install Node.js?
Node Binaries vs Version Manager
## Next, create a new file hello.js and copy in the following code

## Node.js Has Excellent Support for Modern JavaScript


* As can be seen on this compatibility table, Node has excellent support for ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond. As you’re only targeting one runtime (a specific version of the V8 engine), this means that you can write your JavaScript using the latest and most modern syntax. It also means that you don’t generally have to worry about compatibility issues — as you would if you were writing JavaScript that would run in different browsers
## Introducing npm, the JavaScript Package Manager


* As I mentioned earlier, Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm. To check which version you have installed on your system, type npm -v.

## Installing a Package Globally

npm install -g jshint

## Installing a Package Locally
* npm init -y
