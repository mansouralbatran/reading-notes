## What is functional programming?

* Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable


1. pure functions
* It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)

* Pure functions benefits
   * Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B
   * Give*n a parameter C → expect the function to return value D


   ## Immutability

   * When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value


   ## Referential transparency

   )
   * pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

   ## Higher-order functions
